# Drop It
Drop It is an Garry's Mod addon that allows the players to manage
their inventories by dropping, removing, or stripping ammo from
weapons via key bindings, or an GUI inventory manager.

## Where do I get it?
From the [Workshop](TODO:link), of course! You can also install it
locally by putting the main directory with addon in
`garrysmod/addons`.

## Migrating from Drop It 1.x
Alright, so you've installed Drop It 2.0, which is incompatible with
any 1.x version. As Drop It 2.0 uses different method for handling
key bindings, you have to unbind your actual Drop It 1.x binds.

In order to do it, open the console in Garry's Mod and execute
`unbind [key which has a Drop It bind]` for every key with Drop It
1.x bind.

Now uninstall old Drop It 1.0. Now configure Drop It 2.0's binds
as you wish.

If you're installing Drop It 2.0 for the first time, ignore this
section.

## Help, I found a bug!
Oh, that's not good. But there's [Issues](https://github.com/Mcpg/drop-it/issues) section,
where you can report any issue Drop It has. Just make sure to describe the problem, if it's
a bug describe what needs to be done to make the error appear, provide screenshots,
etc - just make the life easier for a developer, he's not a machine (yes we are actually humans)!

## Developer's FAQ - because why not write one

### Does Drop It provide any APIs for addon developers?
Right now no, as I don't see any need for that. If I'd see at least 1
person that wants these kind of APIs to be added, I will add them.
